# AGENTS.md — bd_shrink.sh

## Project overview

Single-file **bash** script that shrinks BD50 Blu-ray backups or video files to BD25-compatible BDMV folders. Built-in Python heredocs handle MPLS binary parsing, demuxing, and data processing. Output is authored with `tsMuxeR`.

- Source: BDMV folder, parent folder containing `BDMV/`, ISO image file (`.iso`), or a single video file (`.mkv`/`.mp4`/`.m4v`)
- `--movie-only` is the reliable mode; default surgical mode preserves original menus and structure (IGS/HDMV and BD-J)
- `--codec hevc` uses `libx265` when `tsMuxeR` supports `V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC`

## Key commands

```bash
# Syntax check
bash -n bd_shrink.sh

# Interactive TUI (auto-launched when -s/-o omitted)
./bd_shrink.sh

# Movie-only — fresh BD, no menus, works on any disc including BD-J
./bd_shrink.sh -s /path/to/BDMV -o /output -f --movie-only

# Surgical — keep menus; preserves IGS and BD-J structure
./bd_shrink.sh -s /path/to/BDMV -o /output -f

# Single video file (forces movie-only)
./bd_shrink.sh -s movie.mkv -o /output -f

# ISO image input (auto-mounts or extracts)
./bd_shrink.sh -s disc.iso -o /output -f --movie-only

# Burn directly to BD-R (pipes genisoimage into growisofs; no temp ISO)
./bd_shrink.sh -s /path/to/BDMV -o /output -f --movie-only --burn

# Create ISO for archival + burn
./bd_shrink.sh -s /path/to/BDMV -o /output -f --movie-only --burn --iso

# Dependency check (no source/output needed)
./bd_shrink.sh --install-deps
```

## Architecture

Single file `bd_shrink.sh`, shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, `set -euo pipefail` + `trap ... ERR`. Logic lives in inline `python3` heredocs (MPLS parsing, classify, budget, precompute, the entire encode loop). Editing those heredocs means editing Python embedded in bash — the bash `ERR` trap and `set -e` still apply to the surrounding shell, not inside Python.

Phases:

1. **Inventory** — parse `.mpls`, probe `.m2ts` via ffprobe → `inventory.json`
2. **Classify** — largest HD playlist(s) = main movie; rest = extras/menus → `classify.json`
3. **Budget** — target bitrate for main movie after accounting for menus + estimated extras → `budget.json`
4. **Encode** — extras at 720p CRF; main movie two-pass VBR
5. **Rebuild** — surgical (replace M2TS in place, keep menus) or fresh `tsMuxeR` authoring (`--movie-only`)
6. **Validate** — file/CLPI checks

**Two `run_ff` functions, do not confuse them**: the bash `run_ff()` (top of file) wraps commands in `systemd-run --user --wait` (transient service survives a shell crash). A *separate* Python `run_ff()` inside the Phase 4 encode heredoc wraps `subprocess.run` and implements per-clip resume by skipping outputs that already exist.

**Phase 4 runs as a single `python3 -u` process** (one invocation, all extras + main clips). Phase 4/5 metadata is precomputed by one `systemd-run` call writing `.work/.*.txt` dotfiles that bash then reads with `read`/`while read` loops. Adding data for later phases means adding a dotfile in the precompute heredoc and a matching `read` loop.

**Resumability**: the encode phase skips clips whose output already exists. After a crash or interruption, re-run the same command (without `-f`) to resume from where it left off. Do NOT delete the `.work` directory or use `-f` when resuming.

## Modes

| Mode | Result | Caveats |
|------|--------|---------|
| `--movie-only` | Fresh BD with one main-movie playlist | Always works; no menus |
| Default (surgical) | Original menus/structure preserved | Works for IGS and BD-J; re-encoded clips get new CLPI metadata |

## Phase 1: Preflight & Navigation Safety

**Clip-split detection:** if any source clip is split across multiple playlists, surgical mode is hard-blocked with a clear error. Reason: rebuilding would require demuxing/re-muxing the clip to split it, which is complex and error-prone. Workaround: use `--movie-only`.

**CLPI navigation-safety analysis:** the script parses CLPI clip info structures to detect whether re-encoding will change:
- Stream IDs (PIDs) — re-encoding audio codec changes track composition
- Stream coding types — e.g., lossless → AC3
- Clip markers and EP-map entries — may shift if video properties change

If these changes are detected AND menus exist on the disc (IGS/HDMV or BD-J), the script hard-fails during Phase 1 with a recommendation to use `--movie-only` instead. This guardrail prevents shipping discs with frozen/broken menus.

Rationale: navigating from a playlist to the menu relies on the MPLS PlayList referencing specific stream PIDs and CLPI timestamps. If re-encoding changes those references and the MPLS STN_table isn't updated (Phase 2, deferred), the menu composes with old stream IDs that no longer exist → graphics freeze or audio/video mutes.

## Flag interactions

- `--movie-only` implies `--keep-one`
- `--no-extras` skips extras encoding but keeps menus (surgical only)
- `-f` is checked **before** dry-run exit — needed even with `-n` if output exists
- `--iso` creates an ISO; `--burn --iso` also creates one and then burns from it
- `--nice` with no argument defaults to `N=19`; valid range 0–19. Applied via `systemd-run --property=Nice` for the bash `run_ff` and `nice -n` for encoder subprocesses inside the Phase 4 Python process.
- Classification override flags (Phase 2 diagnosis + correction):
  - `--main-playlist NNNNN.mpls` — force a specific playlist as the main movie (overrides heuristic detection)
  - `--extra NNNNN.mpls,MMMMM.mpls` — force one or more playlists as extras (comma-separated, `.mpls` optional)
  - `--menu NNNNN.mpls` — force a specific playlist as a menu/non-encode
  - `--not-extra NNNNN.mpls` — exclude a playlist from extras (reclassify as menu)
  - Overrides are applied after heuristic classification; re-logged in Phase 2 output
  - Useful when auto-classification misidentifies content type (e.g., a 90-min documentary classified as alternate cut)

## Burn path

`--burn` alone pipes `genisoimage -udf -allow-limited-size` directly to `growisofs` — no temp ISO. `--burn --iso` creates an ISO first, then burns it.

Critical details:

- `genisoimage` and `growisofs` are required for direct burning
- `burn_output()` resolves full binary paths via `command -v` before passing to `run_ff()`, because `run_ff()` launches via `systemd-run` with a restricted `PATH` (`/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin`) that may not include Homebrew or other non-standard bin directories
- `MKISOFS` is set to the full path of `genisoimage` when calling `growisofs` because `/usr/bin/mkisofs` on this system is `xorriso`'s stub and does **not** support `-udf`
- `-allow-limited-size` is required; M2TS files commonly exceed 4 GiB
- UDF 2.00 is what `genisoimage` produces; players that strictly require UDF 2.50 may still reject the disc
- No MD5 verification; growisofs handles BD-R write verification internally

## Menu preservation (surgical mode)

Menu clips are excluded from re-encoding via three signals:

1. `PlayList_type == 1` read from the MPLS `AppInfoPlayList` struct
2. Any playlist sharing a clip with a known menu playlist
3. Zero chapter marks + duration < 120 s (warnings, logos, transitions)

Their clips are copied verbatim so IGS (Interactive Graphics) overlays stay intact. Anything else classified as an extra is re-encoded to 720p.

### SubPath clips

The MPLS parser extracts SubPlayItem clips from SubPath entries (not just the main PlayList). SubPath length is a 4-byte uint per the BDMV spec. SubPath clips are added to the playitems list with duration 0 so they flow through inventory → classification → rebuild without affecting the playlist's total duration. This catches clips referenced only via sub-paths (e.g. menu background video, PiP, seamless branching).

### Orphan-clip safety net

After copying all playlist-referenced clips, the surgical rebuild does a final pass over `SOURCE/STREAM/*.m2ts` and copies any file not already in the output. This catches clips that exist on the disc but are referenced by navigation structures outside of MPLS (e.g. `MovieObject.bdmv` FirstPlayback/TopMenu entries).

### Extras classification heuristics

The script distinguishes "alternate cuts" (alternate angles, scene selections) from "extras" (behind-the-scenes, featurettes) to avoid encoding alternate angles at 720p when they share clips with the main movie. Key signals:

- **Duplicate-clip detection:** playlists sharing clips with the main movie are classified as menu-like structures (not encoded)
- **Alternate-cut window:** playlists with duration ±25% of main, size ±50% of main, AND matching chapter count are treated as alternate cuts (menu-like, copied as-is)
- **Extras floor (50 MB minimum):** playlists < 50 MB (even if duration suggests extras) are classified as menus/warnings/logos and copied instead of re-encoded
- **Short-duration floor:** playlists < 120 s with zero chapters are classified as transitions/logos and copied

These heuristics are applied after MPLS classification (playlist_type field) and can be overridden via `--extra`, `--not-extra`, and `--menu` flags for edge cases (e.g., a documentary misclassified as alternate cut, or a bonus feature too small to encode efficiently).

## Work directories

Default: `${OUTPUT}.work` (sibling of output). Configurable via `-w / --work`. When `-o` points to an existing parent directory without `BDMV/`, a source-named subdirectory is created; the `.work` directory stays a sibling of that subdirectory.

## Logging

Mirrored to a log file in `/var/log/bd-shrink` if writable, otherwise `~/.local/share/bd-shrink/logs`, named `bd_shrink_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`. Also mirrored to `${WORK_DIR}/bd_shrink.log` for convenience during resume.

## TUI mode

Auto-launched when `-s`/`-o` are omitted (requires `gum`). Source selection retries if the chosen folder contains no BDMV or video file, rather than dying.

## Gotchas

- **bash only**: `README.md` still incorrectly says "Requires zsh"; the script was rewritten in bash. Use `bash -n bd_shrink.sh` for syntax checks, not `zsh -n`.
- **`local` is only valid inside functions** in bash.
- Use `read < file` for line-oriented metadata reads; the script reads metadata files with `read`/`while read` loops, not `$(< file)`.
- `EXTRAS_CLIPS` and `MAIN_CLIPS` have trailing newlines from `while read` — trimmed with parameter expansion (`${VAR%$'\n'}`) before use.
- Playlist `clips` arrays are deduplicated during inventory assembly (preserving order).
- **Pass 2 validation**: after encoding, the raw video output (`.h264` or `.hevc`) is checked for a NAL start code; corrupt files are removed so they don't reach `tsMuxeR`.
- SRT subtitles are extracted but skipped in the tsMuxeR meta (tsMuxeR 2.7.0 on Linux lacks font rendering). PGS subtitles pass through. DVD/VobSub subtitles are filtered out.
- Movie-only mode allocates all space to video; audio + subtitle + container overhead can push total ~1–2% over target.

## Known issues

- **IGS/HDMV menu freeze on full-disc re-encodes (surgical mode):** Re-encoding lossless audio (required to fit BD25) changes stream PIDs and track sets. If the disc has IGS/HDMV menus with navigation that references specific streams, the menu may freeze or navigation may fail. The script detects this condition during Phase 1 (preflight) and hard-fails with a clear recommendation to use `--movie-only` mode instead. This is intentional: it prevents shipping a disc with frozen menus. Workaround: use `--movie-only` (always works, no menus).
- **BD-J discs with metadata-dependent Java code:** BD-J menus may reference specific CLPI timestamps or stream PIDs of re-encoded clips. If the Java code depends on exact metadata, playback may malfunction. Most BD-J menus only play playlists and ignore metadata, so surgical mode works for the majority. Test carefully before burning. Workaround: use `--movie-only`.
- Some discs have corrupt H.264 in source clips. The script skips these gracefully; the output will lack video for affected clips but won't fail.

## Non-obvious invariants (do not regress)

These are subtle behaviors that took real debugging to get right. Verify against the code before changing them; grep for the described logic rather than trusting line numbers (the file shifts).

- **Budget uses the UNIQUE encoded-clip set** — `main_bitrate_mbps` is derived from the sum of `duration_sec` over the deduplicated `main_clips`, NOT from summed per-playlist durations. Seamless-branching titles share clips across multiple playlists (alternate cuts/angles); summing playlists double-counts runtime, inflates budgeted duration, and produces a too-low bitrate / too-small ISO. `main_duration_sec`/`main_duration_str` reflect encoded-clip runtime.
- **Python `.format()` in path joins** — inside the heredocs, `os.path.join(..., '{}.m2ts'.format(clip))` is used deliberately; `str.format` on strings containing `{}` from disc paths caused crashes. Do not switch these to f-strings or `%` carelessly.
- **Passlog detection is a glob, not a fixed suffix** — use `glob.glob(pass_log + '*')`. x264 writes `-0.log`; x265 differs. Never hardcode `-0.log`.
- **Resume parity** — on resume, both extras and main clips re-verify the audio track count so a partial prior run doesn't leave fewer tracks than expected.
- **Argument validation** — `--target` must match `^[0-9]+$`; audio bitrates match `^[0-9]+k?$`; `--nice` must be `0-19`. Keep these guards when adding flags.
- **Missing-file guards** — `MovieObject.bdmv` copy skips gracefully if absent (incomplete discs must not fatal).
- **Early exit on no main playlist** — classification aborts with a clear message if no main movie is identified, rather than failing deep in a later phase.
- **Branched-title warning** — multi-clip titles with differing audio/subtitle track counts emit a warning (seamless-branching edge case).
- **Budget reads tolerate truncation** — reads of `.budget_values.txt` use `|| true` so a truncated dotfile doesn't trip `set -e`.
- **ISO temp cleanup** — `.iso` inputs mount under `/tmp` and are cleaned up by the `ERR`/exit trap (`cleanup_iso`), even on failure.
